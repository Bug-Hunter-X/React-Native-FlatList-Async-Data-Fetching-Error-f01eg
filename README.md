# React Native FlatList Asynchronous Data Fetching Error

This repository demonstrates a common but subtle error in React Native when dealing with asynchronous data fetching within a FlatList component.  The example shows how attempting to update the component's state with fetched data after the component has unmounted can lead to errors or unexpected behavior.

The `BuggyFlatList.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `FixedFlatList.js` provides a corrected version using techniques to prevent these issues.  See the detailed descriptions in each file for explanations and solutions.

## How to reproduce the bug

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run the app in your preferred emulator or device.
4. Observe the console for errors or unexpected rendering behavior in `BuggyFlatList.js`.
5. Compare the behavior to `FixedFlatList.js` to see the fix in action.
